### UML

A UML class diagram was created as a more abstract version of an information model and for better clarification of relationships between the domain-oriented concepts. Concepts mapped as groups in ART-DECOR are modeled as separate classes, which here have association relationships to each other. Properties of module 'PERSON' and the module 'CASE DATA' are color-coded from the other properties of the procedure.
